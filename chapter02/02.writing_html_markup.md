## Writing HTML Markup

* HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a language that allows content
  to be marked up in a manner that makes it more understandable to technology, and
  then in turn to humans.
* You can have content on the web without CSS or without JavaScript. But you can't
  have content without HTML.
* Writing good quality HTML is not a specific need of responsive web design. It's
  far more important than that. It's a prerequisite of anything that you want to be
  accessible to all users of the web.
* This chapter is therefore going to be about writing HTML markup. We will be
  considering the vocabulary of HTML, its semantics, or, more succinctly, the way
  we can use the elements of HTML to describe the content we place in markup.

The topics we will cover in this chapter are:
* Starting HTML pages correctly
* The forgiving nature of HTML5 markup
* Sectioning, grouping and text-level elements
* Putting HTML elements to use
* WCAG accessibility conformance and WAI-ARIA for more accessible web
applications
* Embedding media
* Responsive video and iframes



The basic structure of an HTML page is like this:

````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<title>Web Page Structure</title>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
````

* When writing HTML, you will typically be "marking up" or writing content
inside a series of tags or elements. The majority of elements in HTML have an
opening and closing tag. A few, like the preceding meta example, are void and
hence "self-closing."

>> There's only a limited number of self-closing or void elements,
defined here: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
syntax.html#void-elements.


>> They are referred to as void elements because they have no
contents. Presently the void tags are area, base, br, col, embed,
hr, img, input, link, meta, param, source, track, and wbr.



* To exemplify the opening and closing nature of HTML tags, a paragraph of text
  would be most suitably marked up with an opening <p> at the beginning and
  a closing </p> at the end. Note the forward slash on the closing tag, as that's the
  differentiator between the opening and closing tags.


#### Getting the start of HTML pages right

* Understanding what each thing is for
  is important, however. I generally copy and paste the opening code each time, or
  have it saved in a text snippet, and I would recommend you do too.
* The first few lines of an HTML page should look something like this:
````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
````
##### The doctype

* First of all, we opened our document with the
  HTML5 Doctype declaration:
````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
````
* There are no difference lowercase/uppercase.

##### The html and lang attribute

* After the Doctype declaration, we open the html tag; the first and therefore root tag
  for our document.
* We also use the lang attribute to specify the language for the
  document, and then we open the <head> section:

````html
<html lang="en">
<head>
````

##### Character encoding

* we specify the character encoding, which in simple terms tells the browser
  how to parse the information contained within.
* As the meta tag is a void element,
  it doesn't require a closing tag:
````html
<meta charset="utf-8" />
````
* Unless you have a good reason to specify otherwise, the value for the charset is
  always `utf-8.`


#### The forgiving nature of HTML5 markup

* you'll typically use
  lowercase for the most part, wrap attribute values in straight quotation marks
  (not curly ones!), and declare a type for the scripts and style sheets you link to.

````html
<link href="CSS/main.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
````
The fact is that HTML5 doesn't require such precision. It's just as happy to see this:
````html
<link href=CSS/main.css rel=stylesheet >
````

* There's no end forward slash at the end of the tag, there are
  no quotation marks around the attribute values, and there is no type declaration.
* However, easy-going HTML5 doesn't care.

* This more lax syntax applies across the whole document, not just linked assets.
  For example, specify a div like this if you like:
````html
<div id=wrapper>
````
That's perfectly valid HTML5. The same goes for inserting an image:
````html
<img SRC=frontCarousel.png aLt=frontCarousel>
````

* That's also valid HTML5. No end tag/slash, no quotes (although you would
  still need quotes if the value had white space in), and a mix of capitalization and
  lowercase characters.
* You can even omit things such as the opening <head> tag
  and the page still validates!

##### A sensible approach to HTML markup

* Personally, I like writing my markup quite strictly. That means closing tags,
  quoting attribute values, and adhering to a consistent letter case.
* I want my
  markup to be as legible as possible and I would encourage others to do the same.
* When writing HTML documents, therefore, I think you can write clean and legible
  code while still embracing the economies afforded by HTML5. To exemplify, for
  a CSS link, I'd go with the following:
````html
<link href="CSS/main.css" rel="stylesheet" />
````

* I've kept the closing forward slash at the end of the element and the quotation
  marks but omitted the type attribute.

##### All hail the mighty <a> tag

* The `<a>` tag is arguably the most important and defining tag of HTML.
* The anchor tag is the tag used to link from the document a user is on to another document
  elsewhere on the internet, or another point in the same document.
* A welcome benefit of HTML5 is that we can wrap multiple elements in an <a> tag.

Previously, if you wanted your markup to validate, it was necessary to wrap each
element in its own <a> tag. For example, look at the following code:
````html
<h2><a href="index.html">The home page</a></h2>
<p><a href="index.html">This paragraph also links to the home page</
a></p>
<a href="index.html"><img src="home-image.png" alt="A rendering of
the home page" /></a>
````

Nowadays, we can ditch all the individual <a> tags and instead wrap the group,
as demonstrated in the following code:

````html
<a href="index.html">
<h2>The home page</h2>
<p>This paragraph also links to the home page</p>
<img src="home-image.png" alt="A rendering of the home page" />
</a>
````
The only limitations to keep in mind with <a> tags are that, understandably:

* you can't wrap one <a> tag within another <a> tag 
* other interactive element (suchas a button) 
* you can't wrap a form in an <a> tag either.


#### New semantic elements in HTML5

* For our purposes, semantics is the process of giving our markup
  meaning.
* Most websites follow fairly standard structural conventions; typical areas include
  a header, a footer, a sidebar, a navigation bar, and so on.
* As web authors, we will often name the `div` elements we use to more clearly designate these areas (for
  example, `<div class="Header">`).
* However, as far as the code itself goes, any
  user agent, and that includes a web browser, screen reader, or search engine crawler,
  parsing that content couldn't say for sure what the purpose of each of these div
  elements is.
* HTML5 solves that problem with new semantic elements.


In terms of the HTML specification, the elements we will be looking at fall into one of
three groups:
* Sectioning elements, for the broadest strokes in a HTML page. These are the
  kind of elements to use for header, footer, and sidebar areas.
* Grouping elements, which are used to wrap associated elements. Think of
  paragraphs, blockquotes, and content of that nature.
* Text-level semantics, which are the elements we use to designate particulars,
  like a section of bold or italic text or code.

##### The `<main>` element

* For a long time, HTML5 had no element to demarcate the main content of a page.
* It was argued that the content that wasn't inside one of the other new semantic HTML5
  elements would, by negation, be the main content.
* we now have a more declarative way to group the main content: the aptly named <main> tag.
* It's also worth noting that there shouldn't be more than one main on each page
  (after all, you can't have two main pieces of content) and it shouldn't be used as
  a descendent child element of some of the other semantic HTML5 elements, such
  as article, aside, header, footer, nav, or header.


##### The `<section>` element

* The `<section>` element is used to define a generic section of a document or
  application. For example, you may choose to create sections around your content:
  one section for contact information, another section for news feeds, and so on.

* It's important to understand that it isn't intended for styling purposes.
* If you need to wrap an element merely to style it, you should continue to use a div
  as you would have before.
* You can also qualify for yourself whether you should be using a section based
  upon whether the content you are sectioning has a natural heading within it (for
  example, an h1-h6).

##### The `<nav>` element

* The `<nav>` element is used to wrap major navigational links to other pages or parts
  within the same page.
* As it is for use in major navigational blocks it isn't strictly
  intended for use in footers (although it can be)
* If you usually mark up your navigational elements with
  an unordered list (`<ul>`) and a bunch of list tags (`<li>`), you may be better served
  with a nav and a number of nested <a> tags instead.


##### The `<article>` element

* The `<article>` element is used to wrap a selfcontained
  piece of content.
* When structuring a page, ask whether the content you're
  intending to use within an <article> tag could be taken as a whole lump and
  pasted onto a different site and still make complete sense.
* the content that you are considering wrapping in an <article>
  actually constitute a separate article in an RSS feed? Obvious examples of content
  that should be wrapped with an <article> element would be blog posts or news
  stories.
* Be aware that if you are nesting <article> elements, it is presumed that the
  nested <article> elements are principally related to the outer article.

##### The `<aside>` element

* The `<aside>` element is used for content that is tangentially related to the content
  around it.
* In practical terms, I often use it for sidebars, or content as a little tip
  about a related subject in a blog post.
* It's also considered suitable for pull quotes,
  advertising, and groups of navigation elements; basically, anything not directly
  related to the main content would work well in an aside.
* If it was an e-commerce
  site, I'd consider areas like "Customers who bought this also bought" as prime
  candidates for an `<aside>`.

##### The `<header>` element

* the `<header>` can be used for the "masthead" area of a site's header but
  also as an introduction to other content, such as an introduction section within an
`<article>` element.
* You can use it as many times on the same page as needed.

##### The `<footer>` element

* Like the `<header>`, the `<footer>` element doesn't take part in the outline algorithm
  (more on that in the following section) so doesn't section content.
* Instead it should
  be used to contain information about the section it sits within.
* It might contain links
  to other documents or copyright information, for example.
* Like the <header>, it can
  be used multiple times within a page if needed. For example, it could be used for the
  footer of a blog but also a footer within a blog post `<article>`.

##### The HTML5 outline algorithm

* Ordinarily, for an HTML document, headings would begin with an h1 for the
  main page title and then progress to using lower hierarchy title tags as needed for
  subheadings and the like.
* However, HTML5 introduced the ability for each sectioning container to have its
  own self-contained outline. That means it is not necessary to think about which level
  of heading tag you're at in terms of the entire document. You could just concentrate
  on the sectioning container you are currently working in.
* To illustrate why this might be preferable, within a blog, post titles could be set
  to use <h1> tags, while the title of the blog itself could also have an <h1> tag. For
  example, consider the following structure:

````html
<h1>Ben's site</h1>
    <section>
        <h1>Ben's blog</h1>
        <p>All about what I do</p>
    </section>
    <article>
        <header>
            <h1>A post about something</h1>
            <p>Trust me this is a great read</p>
            <p>No, not really</p>
            <p>See. Told you.</p>
        </header>
    </article>
````

* As such, theoretically you shouldn't need to keep track of the heading tag you need
  to use in terms of the whole document.
* It should be possible to use whatever the
  appropriate level of heading tag is needed within each piece of sectioned content and
  the HTML5 outline algorithm will order it accordingly.

##### A note on h1-h6 elements

* Something I wasn't aware of initially is that using h1-h6 tags to mark up headings
  and subheadings is discouraged. I'm talking about this kind of thing:
````html
<h1>Scones:</h1>
<h2>The most resplendent of snacks</h2>

````
HTML5 specification:

>> "h1–h6 elements must not be used to mark up subheadings, subtitles, alternative
titles and taglines unless intended to be the heading for a new section or
subsection."

So, to follow
the advice of the specification, our prior example could be rewritten as:

````html
<h1>Scones:</h1>
<p>The most resplendent of snacks</p>
````
##### The div element

* The most ubiquitous grouping element is the `<div>`.
* The only implied meaning of a div is
  that it groups something. Despite that, you will often see a div wrapping nothing
  but a string of text.
* You should only opt for a div as a last resort. It is the element to use when you can
  think of nothing better.

##### The p element

* The `<p>` element is used to markup a paragraph.
* However, don't think that means it can only be used on text 3-4 lines long.
* On the contrary, use it to mark up any text
  that cannot be better marked up with one of the other elements. 
* For non-specific text, the p element is definitely a better choice than a div.

#### The blockquote element

* A blockquote is used to markup text that is quoted from somewhere else.
* You don't have to wrap the text with any other element, but you can.

Here is a simple example using blockquote. First, there's an introductory section of
text in a p tag, and then a blockquote:

````html
<p>I did like Ben's book, but he kept going on about Scones. For
example:</p>
<blockquote>
All this writing about scones in our sample page and there's no
image of the beauties! I'm going to add in an image of a scone near
the top of the page; a sort of 'hero' image to entice users to read
the page.
</blockquote>
````

##### The `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements

The HTML specification relates that the `<figure>` element:

>> "...can thus be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc."
> 
* So we use it as an element to call out visuals of any sort, and the accompanying
`<figcaption>` provides the means to add some text supporting the visuals.
````html
<figure class="MoneyShot">
    <img
    class="MoneyShotImg"
    src="img/scones.jpg"
    alt="Incredible scones baked to perfection and ready to eat"
    />
    <figcaption class="ImageCaption">
    This image isn't of scones I have made, instead it's a stock
    photo from Wikipedia
    </figcaption>
</figure>

````

* You can see that the `<figure>` element is used to wrap this little self-contained
  block. Inside, the `<figcaption>` is used to provide a caption for the parent `<figure>`
  element.
* It's perfect when images or code need a little caption alongside them (that wouldn't
  be suitable in the main text of the content).

##### `<details>` and `<summary>` elements

* A piece of summary text that when clicked, opens a panel with additional
  information
* Modern HTML facilitates this pattern with the `details` and `summary`
  elements.
````html
<details>
<summary>I ate 15 scones in one day</summary>
<p>
Of course I didn't. It would probably kill me if I did. What
a way to go.
Mmmmmm, scones!
</p>
</details>
````

* Opening this in Chrome, with no added styling, shows only the `summary` text by
  default.
* Clicking anywhere on the `summary` text opens the panel. Clicking it again toggles
  it shut. If you want the panel open by default you can add the `open` attribute to the
  details element:
`````html
<details open>
<summary>I ate 15 scones in one day</summary>
<p>
Of course I didn't. It would probably kill me if I did. What a
way to go.
Mmmmmm, scones!
</p>
</details>
`````

* Supporting browsers typically add some default styling to indicate the panel can
  be opened.
* Different browsers have their own implementations of how we can deal with any
  marker for the details.

* As this is typically not a selector that has been defined in any
  W3C specification, to disable it in this instance, you need to use a proprietary pseudo
  class (note the -webkit- prefix):
`````css
summary::-webkit-details-marker {
display: none;
}
`````


##### The `<address>` element

* The `<address>` element is to be used explicitly for marking up contact information
  for its nearest `<article>` or `<body>` ancestor.
* keep in mind that
  it isn't to be used for postal addresses and the like (unless they are indeed the contact
  addresses for the content in question).


#### HTML text-level semantics

* Before HTML5, text-level semantic elements were referred to in the specifications as
  inline elements.

Let's take a look at the most common and useful text-level elements.

##### The `<span>` element

* The span element is the text-level equivalent of a div.
* It's the perfect element to reach for when you merely want to wrap text in an element for
  styling purposes.

##### The `<b>` element

* Historically, visuals were defined in the markup and the `<b>` element meant "make
  this bold".

However, the specification now describes the `<b>` element like this:

>> "The b element represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn
for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no
implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words in a document
abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in interactive text-driven
software, or an article lede."   


* Although no specific meaning is now attached to it, as it's text level, it's not intended
  to be used to surround large groups of markup. Use a div for that.


##### The `<strong>` element

If you do want to emphasize something for strength, urgency, or importance,
`<strong>` is the element for you. Here is how the specification defines these
use cases:

>> "Importance: The strong element can be used in a heading, caption, or paragraph
to distinguish the part that really matters from other parts that might be more
detailed, more jovial, or merely boilerplate.      

>> Seriousness: The strong element can be used to mark up a warning or caution
notice.

>> Urgency: The strong element can be used to denote contents that the user needs to
see sooner than other parts of the document."



##### The `<em>` element

* I've often used `<em>` merely as a styling hook to provide italic
  text when I wanted it.

I need to mend my ways as the HTML specification tells us:

>> "The em element represents stress emphasis of its contents."


* Therefore, unless you actually want the enclosed contents to be emphasized,
  consider using a `<b>` tag or, where relevant, an `<i>` or span tag instead.

##### The `<i>` element

The HTML5 specification describes the `<i>` as:

>> "A span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal
prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text."

* Suffice it to say, it's not to be used to merely italicize something.

For example, we could use it to mark up the odd name in this line of text:
````html
<p>However, discussion on the hgroup element is now frustraneous
as it's now gone the way of the <i>Raphus cucullatus</i>.</p>
````

Or, perhaps if you were marking up a button in a food ordering web application,
you might do this:

````html
<button type="button">
French Fries <i>No Salt Added</i>
</button>
````

#### Obsolete HTML features

* If you have been writing HTML for a few years, you might be surprised to learn
  there are parts of HTML that are now considered obsolete.
* There are two camps of obsolete features in HTML: conforming and
  non-conforming.
* Conforming features will still work but will generate warnings in
  validators.
* Non-conforming features may still render in certain
  browsers but they may not. It's certainly not guaranteed.
* if you're curious, you can find
  the full list of obsolete and non-conforming features at http://www.w3.org/TR/
  html5/obsolete.html.
* Notable obsolete and non-conforming features that you may
  occasionally encounter are `strike`, `center`, `font`, `acronym`, `frame`, and `frameset`.
* There are also features that were present in earlier drafts of HTML5 that have now
  been dropped. `hgroup` is one such example.


#### Putting HTML elements to use

Let's revisit the example from Chapter 1. If we compare the following markup to the original
markup in Chapter 1.

````html
<article>
    <header class="Header">
        <a href="/" class="LogoWrapper">
            <img src="img/SOC-Logo.png" alt="Scone O'Clock logo"/>
        </a>
        <h1 class="Strap">Scones: the most resplendent of snacks</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="IntroWrapper">
        <p class="IntroText">
            Occasionally maligned and misunderstood; the scone is
            a quintessentially British classic.
        </p>
        <figure class="MoneyShot">
            <img class="MoneyShotImg" src="img/scones.jpg" alt="Incredible scones" />
            <figcaption class="ImageCaption">
                Incredible scones, picture from Wikipedia
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </section>
    <p>Recipe and serving suggestions follow.</p>
    <section class="Ingredients">
        <h3 class="SubHeader">Ingredients</h3>
    </section>
    <section class="HowToMake">
        <h3 class="SubHeader">Method</h3>
    </section>
    <footer>
    Made for the book,
    <a href="http://rwd.education">'Responsive web design with HTML5 and CSS'</a>
             by
        <address>
            <a href="http://benfrain">Ben Frain</a>
        </address>
    </footer>
</article>
````
* I've removed a good portion of the inner content so we can concentrate on the
  structure.
* Hopefully you will agree that it's easy to discern different sections
  of markup from one another.
* However, at this point I'd also like to offer some
  pragmatic advice; it isn't the end of the world if you don't always pick the correct
  element for every single given situation.

#### WCAG accessibility conformance and WAI-ARIA for more accessible web applications

##### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) exists to provide:

>> "a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs
of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally"

* They offer a number of (mostly common sense) guidelines for
  how to ensure your web content is accessible.
* Each recommendation is rated by a conformance level: A, AA, or AAA.
* You'll probably find that you are already adhering to many of the guidelines, like
  providing alternative text for images, for example.
* you can get a brief rundown of the guidelines at http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/Overview.
  html and then build your own custom quick reference list of checks here: http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/.

* I'd encourage everyone to spend an hour or two to look down the list. Many of the
  guidelines are simple to implement and offer real benefits to users.

##### WAI-ARIA

* The aim of Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications
  (WAI-ARIA) is principally to solve the problem of making dynamic content on a
  web page accessible.
* It provides a means of describing roles, states, and properties
  for custom widgets (dynamic sections in web applications) so that they are
  recognizable and usable by assistive technology users.
* For example, if an on-screen
  widget displays a constantly updating stock price, how would a blind user accessing
  the page know that? WAI-ARIA attempts to solve this problem.
* if that's the kind of project you are building, head over
  to http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria for more information. Instead, let's just go
  over some of the most important headline points to consider about ARIA.

##### Taking ARIA further

If you want to explore a solid set of accessible design patterns, the W3C has
a published set you can peruse here: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-ariapractices-1.1/examples/#examples_by_props_label.


#### Embedding media in HTML5

* For many, HTML5 first entered their vocabulary when Apple refused to add support
  for Flash technology in their iOS devices.
* Flash had gained market dominance (some
  would argue a market stranglehold) as the plugin of choice to serve video through
  a web browser.
* However, rather than using Adobe's proprietary technology, Apple
  decided to rely on HTML5 instead to handle rich media rendering.
* While HTML5
  was making good headway in this area anyway, Apple's public support of HTML5
  gave it a major leg up and helped its media tools gain greater traction in the wider
  community.
* Before HTML5, adding video and audio into markup was a bit of a pain. These
  days it's easy.

##### Adding video and audio in HTML

Video and audio in HTML is easy. Here's a "simple as can be" example of how to link
to a video file in your page:

````html
<video src="myVideo.mp4"></video>
````

* It's also possible to insert text between the opening and closing
  tag to inform users when there is a problem.
* There are also additional attributes
  you'd ordinarily want to add, such as the height and width. Let's add these:
````html
<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="640" height="480">If you're reading
this either the video didn't load or your browser is waaaayyyyyy
old!</video>
````
* To ensure we show the default playback controls we need to add the controls attribute.
* For the sake of illustration, we could also add the autoplay attribute.
* Here's an example with the controls and autoplay attributes added:

````html
<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="640" height="480" controls
autoplay>If you're reading this either the video didn't load or your
browser is waaaayyyyyy old!</video>
````

* Further attributes include preload to control preloading of media, loop to repeat
  the video, and poster to define a poster frame for the video, the image that shows
  while a video loads.
* To use an attribute, simply add it to the tag. Here's an example
  including all these attributes:
````html
<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="640" height="480" controls autoplay
preload="auto" loop poster="myVideoPoster.png"> If you're reading
this either the video didn't load or your browser is waaaayyyyyy
old!</video>
````

##### Providing alternate media sources

* The `<source>` tag enables us to provide alternate sources for media.

if the user didn't have any
suitable playback technology in the browser, we could provide download links
to the files themselves. Here's an example:

````html
<video width="640" height="480" controls preload="auto" loop
poster="myVideoPoster.png">
<source src="myVideo.sp8" type="video/super8" />
<source src="myVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
<p><b>Download Video:</b> MP4 Format: <a href="myVideo.
mp4">"MP4"</a></p>
</video>
````
* In that case, we first specified the source of a made-up video format called super8.
  The browser goes top to bottom deciding what to play, so if it doesn't support
  super8, it moves on to the next source, mp4 in this case. And on and on it goes,
  moving down to the download link if it can't reconcile any of the sources listed.
* The type attribute tells the browser the MIME type of the resource.

##### Audio and video tags work almost identically

The `<audio>` tag works on the same principles as the video tag, with the same
attributes (excluding width, height, and poster).

* The main difference between
  the two is the fact that `<audio>` has no playback area for visible content.

##### Responsive HTML5 video and iframes

* The only problem with our lovely HTML video implementation is it's not responsive.
* That's right, an example in a book about responsive web design with HTML5 and
  CSS that doesn't respond.
* Thankfully, for HTML embedded video, the fix is easy.
  Simply remove any height and width attributes in the markup (for example,
  remove width="640" height="480") and add the following in the CSS:
````css
video {
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
}
````

* However, while that works fine for files that we might be hosting locally, it doesn't
  solve the problem of videos embedded within an iframe (take a bow YouTube,
  Vimeo, et al.)
* The following code will add a film trailer for Midnight Run from
  YouTube:
````html
<iframe width="960" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/
embed/B1_N28DA3gY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
````

* However, if you add that to a page as is, even if adding that earlier CSS rule, if the
  viewport is less than 960px wide, things will start to get clipped.
* The easiest way to solve this problem is with a little CSS trick pioneered by Gallic
  CSS maestro Thierry Koblentz here: http://alistapart.com/article/creatingintrinsic-
  ratios-for-video.
* Essentially, he is creating a box of the correct aspect ratio for the video it contains.

* there's an online service that can do it for you. Just head to http://
  embedresponsively.com/ and paste your iframe URL in. It will spit you out a
  simple chunk of code you can paste into your page.
````html
<style>
    .embed-container {
        position: relative;
        padding-bottom: 56.25%;
        height: 0;
        overflow: hidden;
        max-width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }
    .embed-container iframe,
    .embed-container object,
    .embed-container embed {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
    }
</style>
<div class="embed-container">
    <iframe
            src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/B1_N28DA3gY"
            frameborder="0"
            allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
</div>
````

* Simply add it to your page and you're done: we now have a fully responsive YouTube video.

### Summary

We've covered a lot in this chapter: everything from the basics of creating a page
that validates as HTML5, through to embedding rich media (video) into our markup
and ensuring it behaves responsively.

Although not specific to responsive designs,
we've also covered how we can write semantically rich and meaningful code and
considered how we might ensure pages are meaningful and usable for users that
are relying on assistive technology.
